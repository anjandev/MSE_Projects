\section{Progress Section of MazeBot}

We need to summarize our activities throughout the project

\newpage

\section{Mechanical Design of MazeBot}

\subsection{First Iteration}

I think we gotta explain how we divided the task into smaller steps?

\subsection{Mechanical Drawing}

I will make one online? or something like that want it professional right

\subsection{Observations \& Measurements}

Maybe Use table to show all the measurements of the bot such as wheel radius, size of each cell of the maze

\subsection{Conclusion}

Show the final design of the Mazebot

\newpage

\section{Software Design of MazeBot}

Briefly explain the algorithm of the maze bot 

\subsection{Function Description}

Explain what each function does 

\subsection{Flow Chart}

Flow chart of the algorithms (I think there is a online thing where u can make flow chart)

\subsection{Function Parameters}

Yea

\newpage

\section{Appendix}

Source of Code with brief comments
